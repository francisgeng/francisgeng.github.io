        <h3>About Me</h3>
        <p>Hello! My name is Francis, and I am a EECS and Data Science student at UC Berkeley.Gibberish, also called jibber-jabber or gobbledygook, is speech that is (or appears to be) nonsense. It may include speech sounds that are not actual words,[1] or language games and specialized jargon that seems nonsensical to outsiders.[2]

            "Gibberish" is also used as an imprecation to denigrate or tar ideas or opinions the user disagrees with or finds irksome, a rough equivalent of "nonsense", "folderol", or "claptrap". The implication is that the criticized expression or proposition lacks substance or congruence, as opposed to simply being a differing view.
            
            The related word jibber-jabber refers to rapid talk that is difficult to understand.</p>
